# Vascular Simulation Pre- and Post-Processing Pipelines

This repository documents multiple pre- and post-processing pipelines used in vascular simulations. Each pipeline includes a structured workflow with macros and scripts. The order of the pipelines are important as state files are created in some of the first pipelines and are loaded into some of the later pipelines. The Particle Age pipeline for example creates the paraview_valid_region.pvsm state file. The purpose of state files is to retrieve clips and slices information, to be consistent in the metrics calculations. There are some bugs in paraview, which results in clips and slices sometimes being read wrong. This could be fairly easily improved, by saving csv files with the respective normal and center of clips and slices.

# AAA Vascular Geometry Processing (AAA_GeometryStats_clean.ipynb)

The code resamples aortic and iliac centerlines, computes important geometric features such as tortuosity, cross-sectional area, diameter, and perimeter along the vessels. It also identifies the bifurcation origin and normal vector, highlights the point of maximum aortic diameter, and saves key vessel metrics for further analysis or modeling. The script has two branches: One branch calculates geomtric values, while the other computes particle age pipeline necessities.

## Features

- **Cross-sectional analysis:** Computes vessel cross-sectional area, perimeter, and maximum diameter from 3D vascular meshes at multiple locations.
- **Tortuosity calculation:** Quantifies vessel curvature from resampled centerlines.
- **Bifurcation detection:** Locates the bifurcation point and calculates the normal vector at that location.
- **Visualization:** Interactive 3D visualization of the mesh and centerlines with Plotly.
- **Data export:** Saves computed geometric properties and centerline data as CSV files for external analysis.
- **Configurable model selection** for batch processing of multiple AAA cases.

---

# Windkessel Model Parameter Estimation from Flow Profile (RCR_modified_new.py)

This Python script estimates optimal parameters for a 3-element Windkessel model (Z, C, R) and initial pressure offset by fitting simulated pressure to an inlet flow profile using numerical integration and optimization.

---


# Kinetic Energy Pipeline

This pipeline calculates kinetic energy (KE) in vascular CFD simulations based on velocity fields and geometry. The metric was not included in the article as it is assumed to be strongly correlated to volume and Dmax, as the inflow profile were equal in all simulations, making it sort of uninteresting.

   - Execute the geometry preparation script before starting.

2. **Configure Macros**  
   - Change the model name inside both the KE macro and KE calculation scripts.

   - If clipping is needed, name this clip `"extraClip"`.

5. **Run KE Macro**  
   - Execute the KE macro script.

6. **Check Bifurcation Clip**  
   - Inspect the bifurcation clipping; if required, apply a Z-normal clip.
